Plan: I have downloaded data from lichess.org on all of my games since joining the site. This is a text file full of entries of the form

[Event "Rated Blitz game"]
[Site "https://lichess.org/3m1kiAWF"]
[Date "2019.12.07"]
[Round "-"]
[White "hjfree"]
[Black "Fintan"]
[Result "1-0"]
[UTCDate "2019.12.07"]
[UTCTime "07:39:17"]
[WhiteElo "1906"]
[BlackElo "1912"]
[WhiteRatingDiff "+7"]
[BlackRatingDiff "-7"]
[Variant "Standard"]
[TimeControl "180+0"]
[ECO "A40"]
[Termination "Normal"]

1. d4 e5 2. dxe5 Nc6 3. Nf3 Qe7 4. Nc3 Nxe5 5. e3 Nf6 6. Be2 g6 7. O-O Bg7 8. a3 O-O 9. b4 b6 10. Bb2 Bb7 11. Nb5 d6 12. Rc1 Ne4 13. Nd2 Nxd2 14. Qxd2 Qg5 15. f3 Nxf3+ 16. Bxf3 Bxf3 17. Rxf3 Bxb2 18. Rcf1 a6 19. Nxc7 Ra7 20. Nd5 Rc8 21. Nf6+ Kg7 22. Ne4 f5 23. Nxg5 1-0

I will only look at Rated Blitz games, since these are the ones I play most consistently, and comprise the vast majority of my games.
I will use a vim search and replace to delete all games not of this type. Then I will delete the Event variable from all entries.
I will also delete the Site variable which links to each game.
I think I will not keep the date; I do not think time series analysis will yield much information, as my rating has not really changed much overall during the years I have been on the site. I might ignore some first selection of games - during the initial period after registration, the rating change coefficient is much larger, as the algorithm works its way to the correct rating approximation.
I will remove the Round variable, as most of my games were not played in Tournaments. 
I will not keep the list of names, but I will introduce a My_Colour variable.
I will keep the result, but will change it to reflect My_Score as opposed to having it written by colour.
I will remove the UTCDate and Time.
I will preserve my opponents Elo but not my own.
I will remove the RatingDiffs.
I will remove any entries that are not of a Standard variant, and then delete this variable. 
I might remove the TimeControl. I think the only Blitz variants I play are 180+0 or 120+1... I guess it could be interesting to compare those, maybe. (120 is the number of seconds per game, 1 is the extra time increment a player gets after every move).
I will remove the ECO (the opening name), but I will, I think, keep the first couple of moves. Theoretically, there are 400 possible combinations, but in reality, I expect there to be far fewer.
I will remove the Termination variable. 

This leaves, I think, the following main variables:
Variables:
My_Score (Three options: 0,1,0.5).
My_Colour (Two options: Black, White).
Opponent_Rating (Probably a range of under 2000).
Opening (I don't know. Max 400, Realistically, probably about 30).
Possibly Time_Control (I think "180+0" and "120+1" are the only options).

When it comes to simulating my own data, we shall see what happens, but at least this analysis is more interesting to me than picking some widget factory production costs. 

I will keep a list here of the vim search and replace commands that I use to edit the data down into its final form before I can use it as my database.

Remove all Site entries
:%s/\n\[Site.*$//g

Remove all Round, UTC, Diff, ECO, Termination entries
:%s/\n\[\(Round\|UTC\|.*Diff\|ECO\|Termination\).*$//g

Remove all but the first two moves of the games, and we'll split those in twain
:%s/\n1\. \(.*\) \(.*\) 2\..*\n/\[First Move "\1"\]\r\[Second Move "\2"\]/g

I have here split the first two moves into separate variables. I may in time come to regret this and revert. Perhaps I can use it to predict my or my opponents' responses.. who knows...

The data at this point looks like
[Event "Rated Blitz game"]
[Date "2019.12.07"]
[White "hjfree"]
[Black "Fintan"]
[Result "1-0"]
[WhiteElo "1906"]
[BlackElo "1912"]
[Variant "Standard"]
[TimeControl "180+0"]
[First Move "d4"]
[Second Move "e5"]

It may be time to convert to a database and manipulate from there.
